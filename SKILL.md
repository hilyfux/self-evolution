# Boost

Generic optimization loop for any target with observable behavior and a goal.

## Hard Rules

These are not suggestions. Violating any is a failure.

1. Follow Steps 1–7 in order. Do not skip or reorder.
2. Each step MUST produce visible output under its step heading.
3. Do not edit anything before Step 3 (Observe) is complete.
4. Do not declare success without evidence from Step 6 (Validate).
5. The target is never this skill unless the user explicitly names it as target.
6. If the user says "先不要改" / "analyze only" / "just diagnose", stop after Step 4.
7. After each executed change, decide: keep / rollback / next. Do not stack unvalidated changes.

## Step 1: Target

Name the object being optimized.

- If the user names a concrete object, that is the target.
- If the user says "当前项目" / "this project", the target is the surrounding project, not this skill.
- If ambiguous, ask one question to disambiguate. Only one.

Output:

> **Confirmed Target:** <the object you will optimize>

Do not proceed until the target is named.

## Step 2: Goal

State what success means in concrete terms.

If the user's intent is vague ("优化一下", "make it better"), ask 1–2 sharp questions:

- "最让你头疼的问题是什么？" / "What hurts most?"
- "如果只改一件事，你最希望看到什么变化？" / "If you could fix one thing, what would it be?"

Do not ask more than 2 questions. Do not ask about how to validate or what metrics to track — figure those out yourself.

Output:

> **Confirmed Goal:** <what success looks like>

Do not proceed until the goal is actionable.

## Step 3: Observe

Read the actual artifact using tools. Do not guess from memory. Capture the current state as baseline before any change. For read-heavy targets, delegate to the `boost-observer` subagent to keep the main context clean.

Output:

> **Baseline:** <specific observations about current state>

Do not propose or execute changes until this step is complete.

## Step 4: Diagnose

Build a problem model: Symptom → Impact → Cause → Confidence → Evidence.

Pick the single highest-leverage intervention. Do not present a menu of equal options — choose one and justify it.

Output:

> **Diagnosis:** <the problem, with evidence>
>
> **Intervention:** <one specific change and why>

## Step 5: Execute

Apply the change. State exactly what you changed and where.

If the user requested analysis only, stop here and output the plan without executing.

Output:

> **Executed:** <what was changed, on what scope>

## Step 6: Validate

A PostToolUse hook automatically reminds you after every edit — do not ignore it. Run a concrete check: read the changed file, run tests, diff before/after, or produce output and inspect it. "I believe it improved" is not validation — show evidence.

Output:

> **Checked:** <what you verified and how>
>
> **Before → After:** <concrete comparison>
>
> **Decision:** keep / rollback / next — with evidence

## Step 7: Next

If the goal is met, state why and stop.

If not, emit the visible state checkpoint and loop back to Step 3:

> **[boost · Iter N]** 上轮：<result> → 本轮：<next target>

### Stop when

- The goal is met
- The user asks to pause
- Further change would cause more harm than benefit
- You need information only the user can provide

State exactly why you are stopping.

## When to Use

Use when the user wants to improve, optimize, diagnose, or iterate on something and no more specialized skill covers the target.

Do not use for explanation-only, brainstorming-only, or clerical tasks.
